# Color-Recognition

## Description
This is a basic Python project based on recognizing the color by using the color code given by the user. It can be used for the many various AI & ML projects on something related to the colors as a small feature in it.

## Working 
The project is based on the open source python library named web-colors as the library consists of a dictionary with the key-value pair of the colors and their hash codes.
So whenever the user gives the color code of a color the the code will show the user the exact color of the color code to the user(if present) or will give the nearest color present to the given color code by the user.
The matplotlib library then would show you the visual representation of the color by plotting the color box on an actual graph.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo in your local machine
2. Install the required libraries namely :
    a. web-colors
    b. matplotlib
3. Run the code on any of your editor / IDE
4. Enter the values for x, y & z as the color code for eg (x=255, y=0, z=0 [Red])
5. You will get the text output as well as the visual representation of the color.
